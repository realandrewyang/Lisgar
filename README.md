# hs_math library by Andrew Yang

## Coming Soon
The hs_math library will soon be adapted into a web application where you can access the same functionality without having to run the functions in a Python interpreter.

## Overview
High school math can be a pain for different students at different levels. Some students find it too easy, while others struggle to make any sense of it. We live in a world where technology has changed every aspect of our lives: the way we talk, the way we learn, the way we think. The goal of this project to help students of all levels achieve greater mathematical success.

## Description
hs_math is a Python 3 library that comes with a comprehensive set of functions designed to help students verify problems they may encounter in a high school math class. **Note: I do not condone or encourage using this library to simply do your math homework faster unless you are so confident in your understanding of the material that you believe you are two years ahead of the curriculum.**

## Background
When I took Grade 9 math in high school, I didn't feel challenged enough by what I was learning. The work we did in analytic geometry usually involved solving for one or two unknown in the equation of a line (y = mx + b). At the same time, I was taking a Grade 10 course called "Introduction to Computer Studies", where I first learned how to code. We were using BASIC in class, but one of my friends encouraged me to learn Python, and I quickly realized that I could save a lot of time on my math homework by writing functions in Python for solving certain unknowns. Over the years, as I took more advanced math classes, I started feeling challenged enough that I actually wanted to do my homework properly, to better understand the material. However, having some pre-defined functions to verify my answers would have helped immensely, as senior-level textbooks usually only provide answers for half of the questions.
