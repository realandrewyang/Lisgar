# hs_math library by Andrew Yang

## Coming Soon
The hs_math library will soon be adapted into a web application where you can access the same functionality without having to run the functions in a Python interpreter.

## Description
hs_math is a Python 3 library that comes with a comprehensive set of functions designed to help students verify problems they may encounter in a high school math class. **Note: I do not condone or encourage using this library to simply do your math homework faster unless you are so confident in your understanding of the material that you believe you are two years ahead of the curriculum.**
