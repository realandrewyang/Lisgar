# Python Projects

This repository contains a variety of Python 3 Modules that I made in high school to help me do my math homework faster. Topic range from analytic geometry, combinatorics, number theory, and more. You will also find a file called "Simulation.py" that includes a simulation program (Monte Carlo method) that I wrote in Grade 11 for my AP Stats Summative to calculate the odds of winning a casino game I designed.
